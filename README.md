# Caardvark
Caardvark is a flashcard study web application built in the C#/.NET stack that allows users to create flashcard decks and cards and use them to play simple games.

## Description
This program allows users to register, login, create decks of flashcards and flashcards, add and remove cards, edit cards and decks, tag decks, and complete simple learning activities using their created materials including a study sessions and games. 

This project was initially created as a final capstone for Tech Elevator alongside two colleges. We created this project using C#/.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET Web API, Vue.js, ADO.NET, and SQL with Git, Visual Studio, and Microsoft SQL Server. I illustrated the images of aardvarks, the logo and homepage character, using Procreate for this project. Since graduating from the Tech Elevator, I have continued to refactor the application and it is now at version 2.

## Updates Coming Soon
- Changes to styling for the Deck Details and Modify Deck features
- Updated search bar features
- Restrictions to access based on roles
- Results display in the Study Session feature
